# Quant Connect Algorithms
First experiments on the [Quantconnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/) platform based on Machine Learning.
Currently there are two algorithms: 
1) QCTechnicalML: Technical algorithm, predicting the next period returns based on the last n returns
2) QCTechnicalCryptoML: Technical algorithm like number 1 but for BitCoin
3) QCValueML: Fundamental algorithm, predicting then next period returns based on few fundamental indicators

There is also a notebook I used to explore the technical algo with some simple analyses.

Implementation is rough and naive so comments and suggestions are welcome.
